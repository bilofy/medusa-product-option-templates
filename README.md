# Medusa v2 Plugin: Product Option Templates by Product Type

Make product options reusable. This Medusa Admin plugin lets you define option templates once per product type (e.g., Size, Color) and apply them to products with a click. It avoids repetitive data entry, skips options already present, and supports “Use” or “Use All” right inside the product page.
